Briefing of SPDApp2 web application
===================================

(This application is developed for my personal needs) 
Main goal - is the accounting of individual-entrepreneurs (agreements, payments, accounts, 
printing documents, payroll calculation). 
 
For example
===========
Our firm has some individual-entrepreneurs. We've got agreement with each entrepreneur. Every agreement 
has got specification and service act.
As result we are able to print the specification to agreement and service act.
 
Current features
================
+ add services for all controllers?
+ change jsp -> jspx
[resolved] исправить баг с неправильным представлением названия банка (пропадают данные из-за кавычек)
 
Future features
===============
* Agreement template printing for entrepreneur
* Agreement pdf files saving into BD (upload, download)
* REST WS
